    <h1>Heart Disease Prediction Features</h1>

    <h2>1. Age</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    Age is a significant factor in heart disease risk. The risk of heart disease increases with age, especially after the age of 45 for men and 55 for women.</p>

    <h2>2. Sex</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    Biological sex (male or female) is another important factor. Men are generally at a higher risk for heart disease at an earlier age compared to women. However, women's risk increases and may surpass that of men after menopause.</p>

    <h2>3. Chest Pain Type (cp)</h2>
    <p><strong>Types of Chest Pain:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Typical Angina:</strong> Chest pain associated with physical exertion or stress, relieved by rest.</li>
        <li><strong>Atypical Angina:</strong> Chest pain not related to exertion.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Anginal Pain:</strong> Chest pain not related to heart conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Asymptomatic:</strong> No chest pain.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    Different types of chest pain can indicate various underlying conditions. Typical angina is most often associated with coronary artery disease.</p>

    <h2>4. Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    The blood pressure when at rest, measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). High resting blood pressure (hypertension) is a risk factor for heart disease.</p>

    <h2>5. Serum Cholesterol (chol)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    The total cholesterol level in the blood, measured in mg/dL. High levels of cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL), can lead to a buildup of plaques in arteries and increase the risk of heart disease.</p>

    <h2>6. Fasting Blood Sugar &gt; 120 mg/dL (fbs)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    Indicates whether the fasting blood sugar level is greater than 120 mg/dL. High fasting blood sugar is a marker for diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for heart disease.</p>

    <h2>7. Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    Results of the resting electrocardiogram (ECG), which can show abnormalities like left ventricular hypertrophy or ST-T wave abnormalities, indicating potential heart issues.</p>

    <h2>8. Max Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    The highest heart rate achieved during a stress test. Lower values may indicate poor cardiovascular fitness and higher risk for heart disease.</p>

    <h2>9. Exercise Induced Angina (exang)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    Indicates whether exercise causes angina (chest pain). Exercise-induced angina can be a sign of coronary artery disease.</p>

    <h2>10. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    The difference in the ST segment depression on the ECG between rest and exercise. ST depression can indicate ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart).</p>

    <h2>11. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    The slope of the peak exercise ST segment on the ECG. Different slopes can indicate various heart conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Upsloping:</strong> Generally considered normal.</li>
        <li><strong>Flat:</strong> May indicate ischemia.</li>
        <li><strong>Downsloping:</strong> Strong indicator of ischemia and heart disease.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    The number of major blood vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy during an angiography. More colored vessels often indicate more severe coronary artery disease.</p>

    <h2>13. Thalassemia (thal)</h2>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
    Indicates the presence of a blood disorder that affects hemoglobin production:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Normal (3):</strong> No thalassemia.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed Defect (6):</strong> Thalassemia present, defect does not change with exercise.</li>
        <li><strong>Reversible Defect (7):</strong> Thalassemia present, defect changes with exercise.</li>
    </ul>
