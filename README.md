# Heart Disease Prediction Features

## 1. Age
**Explanation:**  
Age is a significant factor in heart disease risk. The risk of heart disease increases with age, especially after the age of 45 for men and 55 for women.

## 2. Sex
**Explanation:**  
Biological sex (male or female) is another important factor. Men are generally at a higher risk for heart disease at an earlier age compared to women. However, women's risk increases and may surpass that of men after menopause.

## 3. Chest Pain Type (cp)
**Types of Chest Pain:**
- **Typical Angina:** Chest pain associated with physical exertion or stress, relieved by rest.
- **Atypical Angina:** Chest pain not related to exertion.
- **Non-Anginal Pain:** Chest pain not related to heart conditions.
- **Asymptomatic:** No chest pain.

**Explanation:**  
Different types of chest pain can indicate various underlying conditions. Typical angina is most often associated with coronary artery disease.

## 4. Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
**Explanation:**  
The blood pressure when at rest, measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). High resting blood pressure (hypertension) is a risk factor for heart disease.

## 5. Serum Cholesterol (chol)
**Explanation:**  
The total cholesterol level in the blood, measured in mg/dL. High levels of cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL), can lead to a buildup of plaques in arteries and increase the risk of heart disease.

## 6. Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dL (fbs)
**Explanation:**  
Indicates whether the fasting blood sugar level is greater than 120 mg/dL. High fasting blood sugar is a marker for diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for heart disease.

## 7. Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)
**Explanation:**  
Results of the resting electrocardiogram (ECG), which can show abnormalities like left ventricular hypertrophy or ST-T wave abnormalities, indicating potential heart issues.

## 8. Max Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
**Explanation:**  
The highest heart rate achieved during a stress test. Lower values may indicate poor cardiovascular fitness and higher risk for heart disease.

## 9. Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
**Explanation:**  
Indicates whether exercise causes angina (chest pain). Exercise-induced angina can be a sign of coronary artery disease.

## 10. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak)
**Explanation:**  
The difference in the ST segment depression on the ECG between rest and exercise. ST depression can indicate ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart).

## 11. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)
**Explanation:**  
The slope of the peak exercise ST segment on the ECG. Different slopes can indicate various heart conditions:
- **Upsloping:** Generally considered normal.
- **Flat:** May indicate ischemia.
- **Downsloping:** Strong indicator of ischemia and heart disease.

## 12. Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca)
**Explanation:**  
The number of major blood vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy during an angiography. More colored vessels often indicate more severe coronary artery disease.

## 13. Thalassemia (thal)
**Explanation:**  
Indicates the presence of a blood disorder that affects hemoglobin production:
- **Normal (3):** No thalassemia.
- **Fixed Defect (6):** Thalassemia present, defect does not change with exercise.
- **Reversible Defect (7):** Thalassemia present, defect changes with exercise.
